<p style=""><b>Our Vision-Mission Statement</b><br></p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Things to Come Mission, Inc. endeavors to follow the global ministry concerns of the Apostle Paul as he follows Christ. It envisions to establish a Grace Church in every municipality and city in the Philippines and commits itself to win the lost, edify the saints, plant reproducing Grace churches, and produce committed believers in the teachings of Grace whose lives are Christ-like in character.<br><br></p><p><b>Mission</b></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The mission and commission of the Church, which is His Body is to proclaim the message of reconciliation (II Corinthians 5:14-21) and to preach Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery (Romans 16:25; Ephesians 3:8,9) with all boldness. In this, we should follow the Apostle Paul (I Corinthians 4:16; 11:1; Philippians 3:17; 4:9; I Timothy 1:11-16). That distinctive message which the Apostle of the Gentiles (Romans 11:13; 15:16) calls "my gospel" (Romans 2:16; 16:25) is also called "the gospel of the grace of God" (Acts 20:24). We, like Paul, must preach the entire Word of God in the light of this gospel (II Timothy 4:2; Gal. 1:8,9) and strive to reach those in the regions beyond where Christ is not yet named (Romans 15:20; II Corinthians 10:16).</span><br></p>
